# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security or privacy issue affecting HDF5
or related ecosystem components, **do not** open a public GitHub issue.

Instead, please follow the specific product’s security policy (e.g.,
email security contact or use the designated reporting channel).

If you are unsure where to report:

- Contact the SSP SIG maintainers via the repository security contact
  (to be defined here once established), or
- Contact HDFG through the official security email listed on the HDF5
  project website.

## Coordinated Disclosure

The SSP SIG encourages responsible, coordinated disclosure. In general:

- The issue is privately reported to the appropriate maintainers.
- A fix or mitigation is prepared and tested.
- A coordinated advisory and release are prepared.
- Public communication avoids leaking exploitable details before a fix
  is available.

## Scope

This repository primarily contains governance and guidance documents.
Security vulnerabilities in these documents are unlikely; however:

- If you find sensitive or inappropriate content (e.g., secrets, private
  data, or overly detailed exploit instructions), please report it using
  the same channels.
