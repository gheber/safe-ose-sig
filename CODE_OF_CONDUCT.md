# Code of Conduct

The SSP SIG follows the Code of Conduct of the broader HDF5 project.
Until a separate document is adopted here, we reference the
[Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).

Key principles:

- Be respectful and inclusive.
- Assume good intent; clarify, don’t escalate.
- No harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks.
- Follow antitrust laws and avoid anti-competitive discussions.

Reports of misconduct can be directed to the same contacts as the
HDF5 project’s Code of Conduct, or to SIG leadership, who will
coordinate with project governance.
