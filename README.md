# HDF5 Safety, Security & Privacy (SSP) Special Interest Group

This repository hosts the governance, processes, and artifacts of the HDF5
Safety, Security, and Privacy (SSP) Special Interest Group (SIG).

The SSP SIG exists to:

- Improve the safety, security, and privacy posture of the HDF5 library,
  file format, and ecosystem.

  implementers across the ecosystem.

We welcome participation from:

- Contributors and maintainers of HDF5 and related projects (HSDS, tools, bindings, etc.).
- Organizations that deploy HDF5 in production (research, HPC, industry, cloud).
- Security, privacy, and reliability practitioners with relevant expertise.
