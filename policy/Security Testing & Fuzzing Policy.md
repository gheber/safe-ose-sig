# Security Testing & Fuzzing Policy

**Policy intent:** Continuously discover parsing, plugin, and ecosystem vulnerabilities proactively (not “whack-a-mole”), consistent with Safe‑OSE and S2‑D2 emphasis on fuzzing, edge cases, and vulnerability testing frameworks.

The HDF5 repo surfaces signals of active security testing such as OSS-Fuzz status and CVE regression indicators.

## Controls

| Control ID | Control statement | Minimum evidence | Audit checklist (how to test) |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| HDF5-SHINES-TEST‑01 | The project SHALL maintain fuzz harnesses for file parsing and metadata handling, including corpora and minimization workflows. | `tests/fuzz/` (or equivalent); corpus repo location. | Confirm harness exists; verify it is runnable and documented. |
| HDF5-SHINES-TEST‑02 | Fuzzing SHALL be run continuously (nightly minimum) with sanitizers enabled for supported platforms. | CI schedules; sanitizer builds. | Check CI schedules; verify sanitizer jobs run and alert. |
| HDF5-SHINES-TEST‑03 | Plugin loader paths and configuration surfaces (e.g., plugin path variables) SHOULD be fuzzed or adversarially tested. | Targeted tests; fuzz harness notes. | Verify at least one adversarial suite exists for plugin loading. |
| HDF5-SHINES-TEST‑04 | Findings from fuzzing/static/dynamic tools SHALL be triaged with severity and tracked to closure. | Issue labels; triage notes. | Sample 5 findings; verify time-to-triage and closure evidence. |
| HDF5-SHINES-TEST‑05 | Security regression tests SHALL be added for every fixed vulnerability class and retained indefinitely. | Regression test list; mapping to advisories/CVEs. | Sample 3 CVEs; confirm tests exist and are stable.               |
| HDF5-SHINES-TEST‑06 | Security testing metrics (coverage deltas, fuzz exec rate, unique crashes) SHOULD be reported quarterly to the SIG. | Quarterly report. | Verify report exists; verify actions taken on trends. |
