# Release & Change Control Policy

**Policy intent:** Ensure releases are controlled, reviewable, and safe—especially given file format stability expectations and broad downstream embedding.

(HDF5’s release process documentation states that maintenance releases are backward- and forward-compatible regarding the file format and discusses interface compatibility reporting.)

## Controls

| Control ID | Control statement | Minimum evidence | Audit checklist (how to test) |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| HDF5-SHINES-REL‑01 | Each release SHALL have a named release manager (or delegate) and an approved release plan (scope, risk items, go/no-go checks). | Release checklist; signed approval record. | Confirm latest release has completed checklist + approver identity. |
| HDF5-SHINES-REL‑02 | All changes in a release SHALL be traceable to issues/PRs and categorized (feature/bug/security). | Changelog/release notes; issue/PR links. | Sample 20 entries; confirm traceability. |
| HDF5-SHINES-REL‑03 | Security fixes SHALL be clearly identified in release notes (with safe wording if embargoed) and linked to advisories when public. | Release notes + advisory links. | Verify latest security fix disclosure is consistent with VULN policy. |
| HDF5-SHINES-REL‑04 | Changes that may affect file-format compatibility SHALL undergo explicit compatibility testing and sign-off (see COMP policy). | Compatibility test reports; signoff. | Confirm presence when format-level behavior changes. |
| HDF5-SHINES-REL‑05 | A deprecation process SHALL exist with documented timelines and migration guidance for breaking changes. | Deprecation doc; migration guide updates.  | Verify notices exist for any removed/deprecated APIs. |
| HDF5-SHINES-REL‑06 | Release artifacts SHALL be reproducible or independently verifiable to the extent feasible (see BUILD policy). | Build attestation + checksums. | Verify provenance exists and matches released hashes. |
