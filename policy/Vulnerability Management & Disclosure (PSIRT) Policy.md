# Vulnerability Management & Disclosure (PSIRT) Policy

**Policy intent:** Provide a predictable intake/triage/fix/disclose process consistent with HDF5’s public guidance to report vulnerabilities privately.

## Controls

| Control ID | Control statement | Minimum evidence | Audit checklist (how to test) |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| HDF5-SHINES-VULN‑01 | A public vulnerability reporting mechanism SHALL exist and SHALL direct reporters to private disclosure (not public issues).  | `SECURITY.md` and/or GitHub Security page text. | Confirm guidance exists and is discoverable from repo UI. |
| HDF5-SHINES-VULN‑02 | PSIRT SHALL acknowledge reports within a defined target window (e.g., 7 days) and maintain internal tracking through closure. | Triage SLA doc; intake tracker (private). | Sample redacted cases; confirm timestamps and actions. |
| HDF5-SHINES-VULN‑03 | Severity SHALL be assessed using a standard rubric (e.g., CVSS) and documented with affected versions and exploit conditions. | Advisory drafts; scoring worksheet.| Sample advisories; verify scoring consistency. |
| HDF5-SHINES-VULN‑04 | Fixes SHALL include regression tests and SHALL be linked to advisories/issues (private → public). | Regression test commits; “CVE regression” references. | Verify test exists; verify it fails pre-fix and passes post-fix. |
| HDF5-SHINES-VULN‑05 | Public disclosure SHALL include: advisory, fixed versions, mitigations/workarounds, and (as applicable) CVE assignment. | GitHub Security Advisory; release notes. | Sample 2 advisories; confirm completeness. |

## OSPS crosswalk

### Status legend

* **covered:** the SHINES control is intended to satisfy that OSPS requirement.
* **partial:** overlaps, but the evidence pointers don’t confirm all OSPS specifics (or OSPS expects additional policy/automation not visible here).
* **gap:** no clear OSPS requirement to map to (often means the SHINES control is additional/beyond OSPS, or OSPS has no equivalent).

| HDF5‑SHINES control | Candidate OSPS control IDs (status) | Basis |

| HDF5-SHINES-VULN‑01 | OSPS-VM-02.01 (covered); OSPS-VM-01.01 (partial); OSPS-VM-03.01 (partial) | SECURITY.md / GitHub Security tab guidance |
| HDF5-SHINES-VULN‑02 | OSPS-VM-03.01 (partial); OSPS-VM-01.01 (partial) | Private intake tracker + acknowledgements + reporting channel logs |
| HDF5-SHINES-VULN‑03 | OSPS-VM-04.01 (partial); OSPS-BR-04.01 (partial) | Advisory drafts + CVSS worksheets + affected-version matrices |
| HDF5-SHINES-VULN‑04 | OSPS-QA-06.01 (partial); OSPS-QA-06.03 (partial) | Regression tests + advisory-to-commit links + “CVE regression” CI |
| HDF5-SHINES-VULN‑05 | OSPS-VM-04.01 (partial); OSPS-BR-04.01 (partial) | GitHub Security Advisories + release notes for fixes |
