# Plugin and Extension Governance Policy

**Policy intent:** Treat extensions as a first-class security boundary. Dynamic loading enables flexibility but can enable arbitrary code execution and silent compromise if unmanaged.

The Safe‑OSE proposal specifically calls out current plugin manager weaknesses (no signature/version awareness, no constraints, no isolation) and proposes a policy-driven runtime enforcement framework (YAML/JSON).

## Controls

| Control ID | Control statement | Minimum evidence | Audit checklist (how to test) |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| HDF5-SHINES-PLUG‑01 | The project SHALL define plugin classes (Filter, VFD, VOL, Others) and a governance model for “Official”, “Registered”, and “Unregistered” plugins. | `docs/plugins/governance.md` | Confirm tiers and requirements are explicit. |
| HDF5-SHINES-PLUG‑02 | Official plugins SHALL require cryptographic signatures and verification support in the loader, with enforceable modes (Off/Warn/Strict). | Loader design doc; config flags. The SC25 plugin signing design includes Off/Warn/Strict concepts. | Verify mode exists; confirm defaults per HARD policy. |
| HDF5-SHINES-PLUG‑03 | Hardened builds SHALL support a “require signed plugins” configuration (build-time and/or runtime). | Build option docs. Example CMake option described in SC25 paper: `HDF5_REQUIRE_SIGNED_PLUGINS`. | Verify option is documented and testable; check hardened build artifacts. |
| HDF5-SHINES-PLUG‑04 | A machine-readable plugin policy format (YAML/JSON) SHOULD be supported to restrict plugin paths, allowed plugin IDs, versions, and resource limits. | Policy schema + example policies. Safe‑OSE explicitly proposes YAML/JSON policy enforcement. | Verify schema; confirm example policies cover path allowlists and version pins. |
| HDF5-SHINES-PLUG‑05 | Registered plugins SHOULD provide minimum metadata: version, license, supported HDF5 versions/APIs, and (preferred) SBOM/provenance. | Plugin manifest template; registry PR requirements. | Sample 3 registered plugins; verify metadata completeness. |
| HDF5-SHINES-PLUG‑06 | Plugin documentation SHALL warn that plugin path settings and preload mechanisms are security-sensitive and must be controlled in high-assurance deployments. | Hardening guide section referencing environment variables. | Verify docs explicitly call out risk and mitigation steps. |

## OSPS crosswalk

### Status legend

* **covered:** the SHINES control is intended to satisfy that OSPS requirement.
* **partial:** overlaps, but the evidence pointers don’t confirm all OSPS specifics (or OSPS expects additional policy/automation not visible here).
* **gap:** no clear OSPS requirement to map to (often means the SHINES control is additional/beyond OSPS, or OSPS has no equivalent).

| HDF5‑SHINES control | Candidate OSPS control IDs (status) | Basis |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----- |
| HDF5-SHINES-PLUG‑01 | OSPS-QA-04.01 (partial) | Plugin governance doc + registry + tier definitions |
| HDF5-SHINES-PLUG‑02 | OSPS-SA-02.01 (partial); OSPS-SA-01.01 (partial) | Verification design + loader docs + enforcement level docs |
| HDF5-SHINES-PLUG‑03 | OSPS-BR-06.01 (partial) | Build options (e.g., require signed plugins) |
| HDF5-SHINES-PLUG‑04 | OSPS-SA-01.01 (partial) | Policy schema + parser implementation |
| HDF5-SHINES-PLUG‑05 | OSPS-GV-03.02 (partial); OSPS-QA-07.01 (partial) | Registry PR requirements + metadata validation checks |
| HDF5-SHINES-PLUG‑06 | OSPS-DO-01.01 (partial) | Hardening guide covering plugin env vars and preload behaviors |
